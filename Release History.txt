27 February 2021 - version 2.5.8
  - Updated TB2K patch with Kiriakos Vlahos latest changes.
  - TB2Common.pas changes: added various global function helpers to support 
    TImageCollection and TVirtualImageList, using RTTI to access fields, 
    properties and methods of structures on VirtualImageList and ImageCollection.
    Otherwise we must include vclwinx.bpl package to the Requires section of the dpk, 
    doing so we must create different packages for different  Delphi versions.
    vclwinx was introduced in Delphi Seattle but TImageCollection and 
    TVirtualImagelist were introduced on Rio.
    If we add vclwinx package and access TImageCollection and TVirtualImageList 
    directly then we can delete the helpers.
    We must use SpGetScaledVirtualImageListSize to get the correct 
    VirtualImageList size.
    We must use SpDrawVirtualImageList to draw an image on the VirtualImageList.
  - TB2Dock.pas changes: removed TTBVirtualImageList, it was added by 
    Kiriakos Vlahos to scale the toolbar images when the floating toolbar was
    placed on a different monitor. The scaling was done by stretching the images 
    with HQ bicubic interpolation.
    It was removed because TVirtualImageList support was added. In my opinion 
    TVirtualImageList is a better solution, instead of stretching the images 
    TVirtualImageList tries to find the images based on the size.
  - TTBDock.GetDockedBorderSize: reverted, the borders should not be scaled.
  - TTBDock.DefaultScalingFlags: reverted
  - TTBCustomDockableWindow.GetDockedBorderSize: reverted, the borders should
    not be scaled.

  - Changed Overview demo to support High DPI and Per Monitor V2 awareness.
